<h1>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h1>
<p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:

Make the meat sauce.
Cook the noodles.
Make the ricotta mixture.
Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.
Cover with foil and bake.
Let the lasagna rest before serving.
How to Layer Lasagna
The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but this is the order you'll follow:

Meat sauce
Noodles
Ricotta mixture
Mozzarella slices
Meat sauce
Parmesan cheese
Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.
How Long to Cook Lasagna
The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.
